# Open Tweet Filter

The open source browser extension to filter tweets.

If you have a lot of tweets filling your timeline about certain topic or person you are not interested in, this extension is for you.
Or, as a user put it in a review, "Ahhhh, I no longer have to see intelligent people talk the same hive-minded shite about TV programs". :-)


## Features:

- Filter out tweets by their contents or by their authors/retweeters.
- Filter out tweets using regular expressions (for example, match all words starting with "auto" using:  /\Wauto/)
- Save your filters using bookmarklets.
- Support for RTL languages.
- Available in Farsi.


## Usage

1. Install the official release from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bdmjagdcpkfpebaaffpafncgkleijako) or [the latest version for Firefox or Safari from here](https://github.com/rstuven/OpenTweetFilter/tree/packages).
1. Refresh you *twitter.com* page.
1. Select the **Filters** option [in the gear icon drop down menu (just below "Lists" option)](http://goo.gl/iZCX8).
1. Enter terms separated by commas in the first field.
1. Enter user names separated by commas in the second field.
1. Toggle **Including** / **Excluding** button before each field.
1. Toggle **Show report of filtered tweets** checkbox.
1. Toggle **Enable** / **Disable** button in the dialog footer.
1. Save the configuration as a bookmarklet. Just drag the **OpenTweetFilter Settings** box and drop it to the bookmarks bar, then you can rename it to describe the filters. You can create as many bookmarklets as you want.
1. Press **Clear** to reset all fields.

Feel free to experiment with the effect of all these settings.
The tweets are not deleted but just hidden,
so you can get them back any time by disabling the filter or changing the criteria.

*NOTE:* We respect your privacy, so no data is sent to any server.
Your filters are processed in your computer and stored in your browser local storage
(so **please, use the bookmarklet feature or keep a copy of your filters in a safe place**).
